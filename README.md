# üíº JobApplication - Spring Boot REST API

## üìò Executive Summary
The **Spring Boot REST API Application** is a lightweight and scalable backend project developed to support core CRUD operations using RESTful services. Built on top of the Spring Boot framework, this application demonstrates clean architecture, layered code structure, and integrates PostgreSQL for persistent storage. It is ideal for microservice adoption or as a foundational template for enterprise-grade REST APIs.

---

## üéØ Project Objective
To design and deploy a secure, scalable, and modular Job Portal backend system that supports end-to-end job posting and discovery operations. The system is built using a monolithic Spring Boot architecture, offering a suite of RESTful APIs for managing job entities, performing keyword-based searches, and handling data initialization. It is intended for cloud-native deployment and supports secure access, efficient data processing, and cross-platform integration.
